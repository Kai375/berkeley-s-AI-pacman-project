# berkeley-s-AI-pacman-project
UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI.

# This project has been developed in berkeley university by John DeNero, Dan Klein and Pieter Abbeel.

# Introduction

Our job in this project is to build general search algorithms for our Pacman agent to collect food efficiently.

In order to check if we managed to build the algorithms correctly, an autograder has been added. 

To use the autograder, type `python autograder.py` in the terminal.

In order to keep the README short and simple, I will reference you to the project's full description here: https://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html
